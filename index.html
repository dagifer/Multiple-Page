    <h1>ü´ì Arepa ‚ù§</h1>
<p>
    One of my best Venezuelan dishes is Arepa. It is a typical dish for breakfast also you can eat on dinner. 
</p>
<p>
    Arepa are from general between Colombia and Venezuela but the different is that Colombian arepa are thinner and are not filled with anything, while Venezuelan arepa are filled and thicker.
</p>
<p>
    Arepa made of ground corn flour, water and salt. You need to put water and pinch of salt in a bowl after you pour cornflour and mixed all them with your fingers until the consistency is solid. Then you create a little flat circle with your hands, like if use your hands to clap and put it on a grill or a frypan until you see a golden or brown approximate 5 minutes per side.
After you cut it in the middle and filled with whatever you choose. 
</p>
<p>The most traditional in the Venezuelan arepa is filling because each of them has a name. I will do my best translate below: 
<ul>
    <li>Shredded beef and cheddar cheese. We call "Pelua" which means is "furry"</li>
    <li>Black bean and cheese. "Domino" which means is "Dominoes"</li>
    <li>Chicken and avocado. Reina Pepiada which means is "The queen"</li>
</ul>
</p>
